## Complex span tasks #
Here we provide three different complex span tasks which allow the user to measure verbal working memory capacity in English-, Dutch- and German-speaking participants. The three different tasks are:
- reading span task: judging the semantic correctness of a sentence and remembering a word
- mixed span task: judging the semantic correctness of a sentence and remembering a digit
- operation span task: judging the correctness of an equation and remembering a digit

### Using the tasks #
The tasks can be used both in a controlled lab environment as well as a web-based test. They were programmed using [jsPsych](http://www.jspsych.org/) (de Leeuw, 2016) and should run in any up-to-date browser. We (will) also provide protocols for the lab versions, as well as R analysis scripts for all the tasks. Please note that each language folder already contains all the additional .js and .css files necessary to run the experiments, so as soon as you've downloaded a folder you should be good to go.
